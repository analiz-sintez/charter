# Project Selection

## Approach

The general framework for project selection hinges on their optionality, as defined by Nassim Taleb: the difference between the maximum possible gain (in the broad sense: financial, reputational, professional growth) and the maximum possible costs.

- The costs for writing an article on Medium are clear and limited, while the potential gain is substantial.
- The costs for creating an open-source clone of an existing service are high and unpredictable, while the potential gain is limited.
- The costs for developing a plugin for an open-source program that addresses a known user pain point are low, with a potential for significant gain (experience, reputation, and, in the case of online software, the ability to deploy one's instance).

Projects with unlimited costs (e.g., assuming legal obligations to a company without guaranteed project financing) are immediately questionable. Projects lacking scalability potential (e.g., exclusive development for a private company) are also questionable, as they do not align with the cooperative's objectives.

### Hobby Projects and B2C

Since participants are primarily engaged full-time outside the cooperative at present, personal motivation is crucial. Therefore, we prioritize projects that we use ourselves and find interesting. This also helps simplify testing and the search for product hypotheses.

### Corporate Systems and Other B2B

We do not accept enterprise projects without a motivated client willing to provide prepayment:

- These projects are usually large, and the cooperative currently has limited resources.
- The cost of error is high for enterprise clients, leading them to make decisions cautiously. Finding such clients and convincing them to work with us or try our solution would require a dedicated role for a product manager or salesperson, which no one in the cooperative currently fills.
- Enterprise clients have elevated reliability and security requirements, which demand extensive effort to meet without guaranteed project success.

Thus, the guaranteed cost of such projects is high, and the potential maximum gain is unknown.

## Process

Step 1: I wish to bring a project into the cooperative. Over the course of a couple of evenings, I create a minimal prototype using AI and StackOverflow. I present and demonstrate it.

Step 2: If no one is interested, I've only spent an evening or two on something intriguing to me. If someone is keen to join, we form a project team.

Step 3: We then need to find at least one user outside the cooperative who can show interest through actions like leaving a prepayment or registering for and using the product.

Step 4: Afterward, I can log the time spent on developing the prototype, testing, customer development, and user search, and proceed with the project.

## Future

In the future, we aim to formalize project selection with some form of voting mechanism. A participant's vote weight will be determined by their past contributions to cooperative projects. Factors to be considered include: launched projects, tested hypotheses, and hours spent.
