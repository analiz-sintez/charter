# Project Selection

## Approach

The general framework for project selection is their optionality according to Nassim Taleb: the difference between the maximum possible gain (in the broad sense: financial, reputational, professional growth) and the maximum possible costs.

- The costs for an article on Medium are clear and limited, while the potential gain is great.
- The costs for an open-source clone of an existing service are high and unpredictable, while the potential gain is limited.
- The costs for a plugin to an open-source program that solves a known user pain point are low, while the potential gain is great (experience, reputation, the possibility of deploying one's instance in the case of online software).

Projects with unlimited costs (e.g., taking on legal obligations to a company without guaranteed project financing) are immediately suspect. Projects without scalability potential (e.g., closed development for a private company) are also suspect, as they do not fulfill the cooperative's objectives.

### Hobby Projects and B2C

Since participants are mainly engaged full-time outside the cooperative at the moment, personal motivation is extremely important. Therefore, priority is given to projects we use ourselves and are interested in. At the same time, this somewhat simplifies testing and finding product hypotheses.

### Corporate Systems and Other B2B

We do not take on enterprise projects without a motivated client willing to prepay:

- These projects are usually large, and the cooperative currently has limited resources.
- The cost of error is high for enterprise clients; they make decisions cautiously. To find such clients and convince them to work with us or try our solution, a dedicated role of product manager or salesperson is needed. No one in the cooperative currently sees themselves in this role.
- Enterprise clients have increased reliability and security requirements. Ensuring these requires much effort without guaranteed project success.

Thus, the guaranteed cost of such projects is high, and the potential maximum gain is unknown.

## Process

Step 1. I want to bring a project into the cooperative. In a couple of evenings, I create a minimal prototype using AI and StackOverflow. I bring and show it.

Step 2. If no one is interested, I've just spent an evening or two on something intriguing to me. If someone is ready to join, we now have a project team.

Step 3. Now we need to find at least one user outside the cooperative. They can leave a prepayment, register and use it, or otherwise confirm their interest through action.

Step 4. After this, time spent on prototype development, testing, customer development, and user search can be recorded. Then we can continue working on the project.

## Future

In the future, we will formalize project selection in the form of some kind of voting mechanics. The weight of a participant's vote will be determined by the work invested in the cooperative's past projects. Considered will be: launched projects, tested hypotheses, and hours spent.
