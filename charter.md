# Charter of the Analiz-Sintez Cooperative

## What We Are Creating

We are creating a **venture cooperative**: a structure capable of financing interesting and risky IT projects under open licenses and ensuring fair compensation for the project participants.

The strategic goal of the cooperative is to guarantee its members a stable opportunity to work creatively on interesting projects, publish them as open source, receive fair compensation, and develop professionally.

The tactical task of the cooperative is to create paid digital products based on open source solutions developed by the co-op and to enhance the cooperative’s reputation.

## Principles

The cooperative is organized on the principles of:

- Meritocracy: influence on decisions is earned through contributions to the cooperative, primarily through work. [This part will later be formalized in the form of a DAO.]
- Do-o-cracy: if a participant believes something needs to be done, they are not required to ask for permission, they can just do it (although the practice of consultation should be rooted).

## What the Cooperative is Not

The cooperative does not aim for significant personal enrichment of its members. Personal profit from work in the cooperative is capped—but with ample room: see [finance.md](./finance.md).

The cooperative does not aim to attract private capital, as private capital involvement in management creates risks for our objectives. (However, we will gratefully accept grants.) The ability to manage the cooperative is provided solely by the work invested in it.

Without diminishing the value of explosive product growth, the cooperative values long-term sustainability more.

## Shares, Compensation, and Profit Distribution

Each participant contributes 500 hours of labor as a share. These hours are to be contributed within three years from the establishment of the cooperative [this is 3-4 hours a week if distributed evenly].

Once the cooperative begins to generate profit, these hours will be compensated at $20/hour, including both new and already contributed hours. [Thus, in three years, participants will earn $10k, which the cooperative will pay from its profits. Essentially, the share value is secured by the actual hourly worth of participant labor being above $20.] A maximum of 50% of the profits can be spent on these payments. All hours will ultimately be paid if the cooperative's profits are sufficient.

Further, by decision of the participants' assembly, up to 50% of the cooperative's profits may be distributed as bonuses. The bonus will be distributed proportionally to the total number of hours a participant has worked for the cooperative since its inception, but no more than achieving an effective rate of $100/hour. [In the future, we’ll complicate the system by adding validated hypotheses and launched projects to the hours.]

> Short rule: "from $20 to $100 per hour, considering all accumulated hours, equalizing effective rates."

## Project Selection

The cooperative chooses projects to invest resources in at the general assembly. These projects must align with the cooperative’s values and contribute to its profit growth directly [e.g., working on client projects or paid courses] or indirectly [e.g., PR activities like articles, development of open source tools, working on the cooperative’s infrastructure].

## New Members and External Collaborators

The cooperative can engage outsiders to work on its projects, paying them $20/hour or through fixed rewards for specific tasks.

Anyone who has worked for the cooperative for 500 hours or more [or completes tasks of equivalent volume] can apply for membership. The decision to accept new members is made by the general assembly. [This way, we attract less experienced individuals for whom $20/hour is a market rate.]
