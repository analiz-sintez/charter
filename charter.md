# Charter of the Analiz-Sintez Cooperative

## Our Mission

We are establishing a **venture cooperative** designed to finance intriguing and risky IT projects under open licenses while ensuring fair compensation for participants.

The strategic goal of the cooperative is to provide its members with a consistent opportunity to engage in creative work on interesting projects, publish them as open source, receive fair compensation, and advance professionally.

The cooperative's tactical objective is to develop paid digital products based on open-source solutions created by the co-op, thereby enhancing its reputation.

## Core Principles

The cooperative functions based on the principles of:

- Meritocracy: decision-making influence is earned through contributions to the cooperative, primarily through labor. [This aspect will later be formalized in the form of a DAO.]
- Do-o-cracy: if someone believes an action is necessary, they are encouraged to proceed without seeking permission (though consultation should still be practiced).

## What the Cooperative is Not

The cooperative does not aim to greatly enrich its members. Personal profit from work within the cooperative is capped—but with significant room: see [finance.md](./finance.md).

The cooperative does not seek to attract private capital since its involvement in management poses risks to our objectives. (However, we will gratefully accept grants.) Management authority in the cooperative is derived solely from the work invested.

While acknowledging the significance of rapid product growth, the cooperative places greater value on long-term stability.

## Shares, Compensation, and Profit Distribution

Each participant is required to contribute 500 hours of work as a share, which must be completed within three years from the cooperative's establishment [equivalent to 3-4 hours a week if spread evenly].

Once profitable, the cooperative will compensate these hours at $20/hour, including both new and previously contributed hours. [This means, over three years, participants will earn $10k, which the cooperative will pay from profits. Essentially, the share value is justified by actual labor being worth more than $20/hour]. A maximum of 50% of profits can be allocated to these payments. All hours will eventually be paid if the cooperative is sufficiently profitable.

Furthermore, up to 50% of the cooperative's profits may be allocated as bonuses by decision of the participants' assembly. Bonuses are distributed based on the total number of hours a participant has worked since the cooperative’s inception but cannot exceed an effective rate of $100/hour. [In the future, we plan to incorporate validated hypotheses and launched projects into the hours calculation.]

> Summary: "from $20 to $100 per hour, considering all accumulated hours and balancing effective rates."

## Project Selection

The cooperative selects projects for resource investment through a general assembly. These projects must align with the cooperative's values and support profit growth directly [such as client projects or paid courses] or indirectly [such as PR activities, open source tool development, or infrastructure work].

## New Members and External Collaborators

The cooperative may engage non-members for project work, paying them $20/hour or offering fixed compensation for specific tasks.

Individuals who have contributed 500 hours or more [or completed tasks of equivalent scope] may apply for membership. New member acceptance is decided by the general assembly. [This approach allows us to attract less experienced individuals for whom $20/hour is a market rate.]
